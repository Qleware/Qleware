                                        <p>Qleware looking to be the term of services must be litigated exclusively in
                                            the court of law, and both parties are concerned with the venue on personal
                                            jurisdiction thereof. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive
                                            agreement between you and Qleware with respect to the Services, and
                                            supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable
                                            to the Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.
                                            Qleware failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so
                                            later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the
                                            Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be
                                            substituted to reflect our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign
                                            any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Qleware
                                            may assign its rights and obligations to any of its affiliates or
                                            subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business or assets
                                            associated with the Services.</p>
